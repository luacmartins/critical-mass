# Critical Mass

# Work / Project Examples

## 1. Our Global Trek - https://ourglobaltrek.com/

A personal travel blog that details my adventures around the globe. I developed the blog from concept to design to implementation. It was originally launched with a custom Wordpress theme that I later changed to React. The front end is rendered with Next.js and data is fetched from Wordpress as a Headless CMS using GraphQL.

## 2. CM Photography - https://photography.lcmartins.com/

I designed and wrote the code for my online photography store. I used React's Next.js framework and TailwindCSS to statically generate the front end. State is managed with React's Context API hooks and data with markdown files. Testing is done using Jest. I integrated the app with Prodigi's API for fulfillment of the prints and canvases, Stripe's API for payment processing and SendGrid API for email confirmations.

## 3. Wallet - https://wallet.lcmartins.com/

Wallet is an automatic expense tracker app that syncs with bank accounts. I designed and developed the entire application. The front end is programmed with React's Next.js framework, TailwindCSS for styles and Recharts library to generate all charts. The back end is running on a Node/Express server and auth is done with JSON web tokens. The app syncs with bank accounts using Plaid's API and webhooks to keep all accounts and transactions up to date.

# Inspiration

## 1. Wealthsimple - https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/

Wealthsimple was the inspiration for the design of my Wallet app. I love how simple, yet efficient the webpage and mobile app designs are. It challenged me to work with charting tools and connecting to banking institutions.

## 2. Next.js - https://github.com/vercel/next.js/

Next.js is a popular development framework for React. The simplicity and powerful tools available for development inspired me to use the framework in all of my personal projects. The framework cuts through the clutter and lets developers focus on what really matters, making development faster and more fun.

## 3. TailwindCSS - https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss

TailwindCSS is an upcoming CSS framework. Unlike many others out there, Tailwind does not provide out of the box components like buttons, inputs, etc. It is up to the developer to still create those. However, the use of their atomized CSS classes make it really easy and fast to develop beautiful layouts. It inspired me enough to adopt it early on and I'm having a lot of fun with it.
