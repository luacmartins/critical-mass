# Work / Project Examples

## 1. Our Global Trek - https://ourglobaltrek.com/

A personal travel blog that details my adventures around the globe. I developed the blog from concept to design to implementation. It was originally launched with a custom Wordpress theme that I later changed to React. The front end is rendered with Next.js and data is fetched from Wordpress as a Headless CMS using GraphQL.

## 2. CM Photography - https://photography.lcmartins.com/

I designed and wrote the code for my online photography store. I used React's Next.js framework and TailwindCSS to statically generate the front end. State is managed with React's Context API hooks and data with markdown files. Testing is done using Jest. I integrated the app with Prodigi's API for fulfillment of the prints and canvases, Stripe's API for payment processing and SendGrid API for email confirmations.

## 3. Wallet - https://wallet.lcmartins.com/

Wallet is an automatic expense tracker app that syncs with bank accounts. I designed and developed the entire application. The front end is programmed with React's Next.js framework, TailwindCSS for styles and Recharts library to generate all charts. The back end is running on a Node/Express server and auth is done with JSON web tokens. The app syncs with bank accounts using Plaid's API and webhooks to keep all accounts and transactions up to date.
